    <p>World Animal Day is celebrated every year around the world on October the 4th on the day of the feast of Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals. The aim of the day is to bring awareness to animal species across the globe to not only highlight the plight of species in the wild, but to also improve animal welfare standards for every animal no matter how big or small.

            In order to celebrate World Animal Day 2018, I would like to share with you one particular animal that is very special to me personally.</p>
